# Portfolio Website - Phase 2 - Wireframing

The purpose of my portfolio website is the following:

1. Showcase my work

I want to prove to people that I've got the skills required not only to make websites, but to meet clients' needs.

2. Personal flair/creating a brand

I want to show what my personality is and what I stand for. Being able to showcase personality and charisma helps
- This may be mundane, but my favourite colour for instance is maroon red. I want that colour to be the main focus of the website.
- I like to take walks in nature.
- I love to immerse myself in technology and gadgets, some of which may be gimmicky.
