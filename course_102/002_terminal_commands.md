# What is a Terminal?

A terminal allows you to insert computer commands, such as creating folders and files, moving to folders/directories.

In the course, we are using WSL Ubuntu (A virtualization of Linux for Windows).

Here are some of the commands you are going to use a lot:

| Command               | Description                              | Notes                                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ls (-l)               | Check a directory's file contents.       | -l is optional, gives extra details for each file. |
| pwd                   | Check what directory you're currently on | print working directory                            |
| cd (folder/directory) | Move to a directory with a given name.   | change directory                                   |
| mkdir (name)          | Make a folder with a given name.         | make directory                                     |
| touch (name)          | Make a file with a given name.           | This is the most common usage of touch.            |
| touch (file_name)     | Update an **existing** file's timestamp. | This is the **primary** function of touch.         |
