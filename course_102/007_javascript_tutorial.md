## 1. What are variables in JavaScript?

Javascript variables store data with a given identifier. Examples include
```
let name = 'Demie'
let age = 24

```
`name` is an identifier which stores the value of `Demie`. 

## 2. What does it mean to declare a variable?

This means you've given a variable a name and value.

## 3. What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

The assignment operator is `=` in Javascript, and it allows you to give a variable a value.

## 4. What is information received from the user called?

These are called 'user inputs', and they can be received through the `prompt() function.` For instance, `name = prompt('What is your name?')` asks the user for their name.
