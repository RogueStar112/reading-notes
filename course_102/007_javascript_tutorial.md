## 1. What are variables in JavaScript?

Javascript variables store data with a given identifier. Examples include
```
let name = 'Demie'
let age = 24

```
`name` is an identifier which stores the value of `Demie`. 

## 2. What does it mean to declare a variable?

This means you've given a variable a name and value.

## 3. What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

The assignment operator is `=` in Javascript, and it allows you to give a variable a value.

## 4. What is information received from the user called?

These are called 'user inputs', and they can be received through the `prompt() function.` For instance, `name = prompt('What is your name?')` asks the user for their name.

### These questions are from 07 - Programming with JavaScript.

## 5. What is control flow?

Control flow is the order of which code is executed. For example, code runs from top to bottom.

## 6. What is a JavaScript function??

A Javascript function runs blocks of code that you put in it, when it is called. To call a function, you typically run it like this `function()`.

## 7. What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

Invoking/calling a function means you've activated that function's code.

`If a function requires parameters, you MUST provide them. Otherwise it'll return an error. For example, imagine the function add(num1, num2). If I run it without any parameters, like add(), it'll return an error. `

## 8. What is the parenthesis () for when you define a function?

The parenthesis allows you to insert parameters, which are variables that are going to be stored in this function.
