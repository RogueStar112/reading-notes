## About me

`Hello World.`
Hi, My name's Demie. I'm 24 years old, and I like to play video games. Games like *Counter Strike* and *Minecraft* are on my radar!
I also like taking peaceful walks round the park, music (especially EDM and Rock)! I may not be the most talkative at times and can
get overwhelmed, but I do what I can!

## Reminders to foster a growth mindset

A growth mindset is believing you can improve through hard work. It's like looking after and growing a plant- you need to water and give it adequate sunlight.
Just like with coding, you give yourself time to read how to code and apply what is learnt.

1. Challenge is inevitable. Embrace it, rather than run away from it.
2. Accept failure as part of the learning journey. Nobody's perfect.
3. Plan what you seek out to do.
