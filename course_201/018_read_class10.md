# Readings: Debugging

## Reading

### What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

Syntax errors stop the code from running, either midway or altogether. Logic errors on the other hand, mean the code continues to run, but with unexpected results.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- Logical error in initialization of for loop: Should initialize loop initiators, such as 'let i', .
- Syntax errors, such as misspelling of variables in JS or elements in HTML/CSS.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Debugging is an essential part of the coding experience. Inevitably you will encounter a programming error in your code, one way or the other, so it's important to know how to counter these when they arise.

### The JavaScript Debugger.

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JS Debugger tool is just another tool in your debugging arsenal. While console.log() and the browser console are one part of it, the debugger

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

A breakpoint is a set point in a program where it stops running, typically for debugging reasons.

3. What is the call stack?

Imagine a call stack as a plate of dishes that need to be cleaned up. The program piles up the functions (or dishes), processing the most recent
functions up until the very first one. This is the best way I can describe a call stack.
