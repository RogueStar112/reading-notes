## Preface

As developers, we're constantly learning, no matter what level you're in. For instance, I don't really take notes super often, but I see that it helps me consolidate what I'm working with. In this case I'm learning how to process information and putting it into my own words. 

## How HTTP sends data between computers

I'm going to sum this up as if this were a compelling story.

The computer comes to life through its power button. The monitor flashes, and straight-away you surf
on the Web.

Your friend calls you on your phone. They're talking about how they're excited about Starfield, the game.

You get very excited, so you look up 'Starfield' on Google. It returned a wide range of results with the word 'Starfield.' 

When you click on the game's website, imagine you are driving to Starfield Land. Before you drive there, you have to know its address. This is where the DNS kicks in. The website's Domain Name System is like a destination for computers to visit.

## How HTML, CSS, and JS is parsed in the browser

Imagine a car being built in the factory. The HTML is like the structure, or frame of the car.

This is to say that HTML is parsed in the browser first. Then, with any `<link>` to CSS goes next.

The CSS is like the coat of paint, and additional visuals being applied to the car.

Then, JS is like the car parts e.g. engine and tyres. They are fit in last.

## How to find images to add to a Website

There are two ways you can add images to your website:

1. Downloading the image
Go to your preferred search engine, and try to look up the image you want. Once you get to that image,
you right click on it and click 'Save Image As', and store it onto your computer locally.

2. Copying the image link as a source.
When you go to the image, left click on the image, right click the enlarged image and then click 'Open Image in New Tab', and copy the URL link.
