# Readings: Images, Color, Text

## HTML Media

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

A real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website is those who are visually impaired, so being able to read the alternate text helps to give context, if the image is not available/can't be read.

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
 One way is to use alt text. If the image can't be loaded, or the user is visually impaired, being able to hear the description of the alt text makes it accessible to both cases.

3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

A figure can be useful for adding captions to an image.
Also, the figure element makes it so images can be linked in one container, increasing browser accessibility.

4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

GIFs can either move or not move. They lose quality the more it's resized. SVG images on the other hand don't
lose quality when resized, making it perfect for icons.

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

It depends. If it's to just display text, I would use a lossless data format like PNG, to minimize
the data size and page load. If image compatibility was a main concern, especially for real-life photos, I'd use
JPEG.

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

Imagine the foreground and background as two different coloured layers, and the foreground is smaller than the background.

The foreground is in front of the background.

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

I'd ask him what colour scheme he would like for his website first. Perhaps shades of green/purple are nice for the eyes, for instance.

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

Consider these factors for fonts:
- Compatibility. Fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, are easily accessible. However fonts like Montserrat require it to be installed throguh Google Fonts.

- Readability. Personally, if using handwriting fonts, I'd use them for headings and I'd use a readable font like Montserrat/Arial for the paragraph elements.


4. Font size affects how big the font is. Font weight affects the thickness of the font, if it's available. Font-style, changes the variant of the font e.g. normal, italic, or oblique.

5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

- You can use margin or padding, to add space to h1 elements.
