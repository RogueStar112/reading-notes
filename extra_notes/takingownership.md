# Taking Ownership of Mistakes/Actions

I've always been a pretty impulsive person. Whenever new technology comes out, the inner [id](https://www.simplypsychology.org/psyche.html) wants to get whatever is at hand. Whether it'd be that new phone, smartwatch, or game, etc. Even in my dreams do I experience strong materialistic desires. 

However, every action we do has consequences. The key takeaway is that you learn to balance your desires with reality. For years, I've struggled to keep a healthy balance, and **taking responsibility**, or **ownership** will be healthier than giving in to temptation in the long run. 

I write this as I myself struggle with addiction, and want to try and help others make the best decision for them.

*For those into biology, this analogy's for you.*

Imagine every problem being a cell, with a nucleus inside. That nucleus, has some degree of autonomy and dependence. You can approach these problems in **two ways**:

## 1. Problems as Threats
<hr>
The problem can be treated as a threat, and as such, it's urgently dealt with. In real life, say you wanted to clean your room. You only clean it when it's desperately needed to do so. Thus, when the room is cleaned, you feel the problem has been eliminated.

Or another example, say you were hungry. My habitual choice would be to order a delivery takeout. While you do stop getting hungry this way, it has knock-on side effects, such as higher spending and less quantity of food given than if you were to cook your own food.

While this can be good in the short-term, it is not healthy in the long-term as you only put those problems aside until they become urgently required to address.

## 2. Problems as Regularly Occuring
<hr>
Imagine a problem that keeps returning even after you've resolved the problem earlier. Say, maintaining a stable income. You have to keep earning money to make up for expenses.

Or when your clothes get dirty after a long day. You have to put them in the washing machine at some point, to keep it clean.

To see the problem as a regularly occuring thing, means you have to develop a habit to combat the problem regularly. 

When I come back to my original example of materialism, it's a battle of the mind. I fight the impulse to insistently get the latest technology, by developing **critical thinking** habits. For example, I will only get a very minor upgrade from my current phone to that latest phone, as I bought mine a year ago. However, my materialistic wants are **impulsive threats**, which have to be addressed with **conscious, combative thinking**.

## What does Problem-Solving have to do with Taking Ownership?

Problem solving isn't just about solving the problem. It's also acknowledging what problems are going to come into your life, anticipating and dealing with them as they go. To **take ownership** of such habits means you've developed some degree of autonomy and repellant to those problems. 

Taking ownership shows **humility**, which is a good way of saying "My solutions aren't the best, but I can always learn from others.".

Nobody becomes a great coder overnight. That is why building good habits, not just in code, but also in life, is important.

Taking ownership requires acknowledging your problems, then understanding that only **you** can change them. Once you've developed self-control, you can do anything.
