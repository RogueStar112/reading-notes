Number 1 Addendum:
Long answer (to elaborate on the concept):
Version control is like storing your files as points in a timeline. Basically, imagine
the first version of your files as the starting point of the timeline, and the most recent save as the end.
Inbetween, there are 'points' where you can load to a previous, or later version, depending on where
you are at that timeline.

A hypothetical example, it's like going backwards to the Big Bang, forwards to the Middle Ages, then back to the 21st Century.

Or another (more realistic example). Taking photos over a span of a year in your phone gallery, and looking at photos within that time period.
